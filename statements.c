#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
  printf("Hello World!");
  printf("Have a good day!");
  return 0;
}

/*Output:

Hello World!Have a good day!*/

/*From the example above, we have three statements:

1. printf("Hello World!");
2. printf("Have a good day!");
3. return 0;

The first statement is executed first (print "Hello World!" to the screen).
Then the second statement is executed (print "Have a good day!" to the screen).
And at last, the third statement is executed (end the C program successfully).

You will learn more about statements while reading this tutorial.
For now, just remember to always end them with a semicolon to avoid any errors.

Coming up: The next chapter will teach you how to control the output and how to insert new lines to make it more readable.*/
