<h1>C</h1>

<h2>What is C?</h2>

<p>&#183; C is a general-purpose programming language that has been widely used for over 50 years.

&#183; C is very powerful; it has been used to develop operating systems, databases, applications, etc.

&#183; It was created by Dennis Ritchie at the Bell Laboratories in 1972.

&#183; It is a very popular language, despite being old. The main reason for its popularity is because it is a fundamental language in the field of computer science.

&#183; C is strongly associated with UNIX, as it was developed to write the UNIX operating system.</p>

<h2>Why Learn C?</h2>

<p>&#183; It is one of the most popular programming languages in the world
  
&#183; If you know C, you will have no problem learning other popular programming languages such as Java, Python, C++, C#, etc, as the syntax is similar

&#183; C is very fast, compared to other programming languages, like Java and Python

&#183; C is very versatile; it can be used in both applications and technologies</p>

<h2>Difference between C and C++</h2>

<p>&#183; C++ was developed as an extension of C, and both languages have almost the same syntax
  
&#183; The main difference between C and C++ is that C++ support classes and objects, while C does not</p>

<h2>Get Started With C</h2>

<p>To start using C, you need two things:

  &#183; A text editor, like Notepad, to write C code

  &#183; A compiler, like GCC, to translate the C code into a language that the computer will understand

There are many text editors and compilers to choose from. In this tutorial, we will use an <b><i>IDE</b></i> (see below).</p>
